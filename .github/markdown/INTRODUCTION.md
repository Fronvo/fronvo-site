Powered by **_BLAZING FAST_** technologies.

Host it, test it, modify it, all yours. **_ZERO_** tracking.

## What's this about?

Have you ever cherished that all your friends move to one single platform?

Or.. let's say that you wanted to get rid of big tech data mining..?

Either way, you can now.

How, you ask?

## Features

-   Communities. Gather all your friends in one and start chatting!

-   Posts. Want to give an update to your followers? Post it on your profile and they will see it on their Home page.

-   Ambient mode. Bring your profile to life with a custom banner (and illuminate it!)

-   Finding the app theme, let's say, a little boring..? Make your own or use shared ones from the Theme Marketplace. (SOON)

-   Want to feel even more secure? Self-host this site AND [the Fronvo server](https://github.com/Fronvo/server) to invite your friends, securely.
